## Instant Orders
### Improved draft 
### Problem statement

The hotel industry is moving towards the kiosk way of handling take in and take outs, this is something missing in some regions and in others improvements are being made to the kiosk systems. This aims at solving a couple of problems: 

* Food selection process is not seamless/the kiosk system doesn't exists
   
* Meals are not easy to customize/Customization option is not available 
  
* Diffuculty in placing the order and selecting a seating station.

* Payment process need to be clear: e.g use Mpesa or Visa etc
  
* Customers pick their own food/ waiters need to be alert and identify which table the order came from  

* Long waiting hours 

* Kitchen staff use receipts to check what order has come in.

* No clear indication of how long it will take to get your meal ready

### Who has this problem

Fast food business
Restaurants
Stay in hotels

### Current solution

The waiter places orders on behalf of the customer
The meal order is then sent to the kitchen for preparation 

### Ideal solution

Build a system that enables:

* Successful food selection by the customer 
  * Clear outline of available food varieties. E.g by offering a scrollable menu(containing prices and quantity)
  
* Allow customers to customize meals 
  * Clear guidance on items available for customization (size, types of sides and drinks)

* Easy processes of placing one's order and selecting a table, if the customer is dining in

* Payment process

* After ordering an item proceed to checkout and pay for the item

* Number calling system, where waiters get called to pick the food

* Reduce waiting time and enable tracking of order status

* Clear outline of the meal order sent to the kitchen in soft copy

* Enable chef to respond with the duration it will take to prep the meal or have this predefined

### Initial draft

Scenario 1: Walk in to the restaurant, get the link on your phone/the hotel can provide tablets. Place your order(meal and drink and make payment) -- to add a customize meal option(this option will help the restaurant know what their customers like most) and then this gets sent to the kitchen for the chef to prep, once the meal is ready you'll get a notification with your order number, you can either go pick it or have someone bring it at your table.
