## Instant Orders

## Purpose: Enable placement of an order without having to wait for someone to take your order.

Scenario 1: Walk in to the restaurant, get the link on your phone/the hotel can provide tablets. Place your order(meal and drink and make payment) -- to add a customize meal option(this option will help the restaurant know what their customers like most) and then this gets sent to the kitchen for the chef to prep, once the meal is ready you'll get a notification with your order number, you can either go pick it or have someone bring it at your table.
